      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:02,070">Welcome back, folks,
to the last section</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:03,920">of the Plains of Prototypes.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:05,744">Hope you had a great time
with all of those challenges.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:08,035">And weren't they a doozy?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:09,790">Yeah.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:10,480">Let's turn to our next topic,
useful properties in the object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:15,350">prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:17,040">Yeah, remember all of those
cool object prototype properties</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:20,370">that we saw at the
beginning of this level?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:22,470">We're going to examine and
use a few of those now.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:25,430">First one we're going to look
at is the value of property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:28,200">Let's say we had two
variables, x and y.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:29,900">One gets assigned 4.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:31,720">And the other gets
assigned the string 4.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:35,090">If we call x.value Of(),
we'll get that property from</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:38,580">the object prototype, and we
get a 4 back, as a result.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:42,130">If we call y.value Of(), we will
also get the string 4 back.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:48,150">Now, why are we trying to
differentiate between these two</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:50,700">pretty obvious things?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:51,980">We just want to make sure
you know that the value</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:54,500">in value Of() isn't looking
for numbers, necessarily,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:00:57,750">but instead returns whatever
primitive type is associated</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:02,430">with the object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:03,100">That's going to come
in handy, pretty soon.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:06,120">Now, if we try to
compare x.value Of() equal</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:10,200">to y.value Of(), we get a true.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:14,110">Why is that?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:15,370">We need to be careful here.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:17,010">That's because the double equal
sign tries to help us out,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:20,480">tries to be our friend by
using type coercion which turns</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:25,390">a number contained within a
string into that actual number.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:30,680">So here, the 4 that
was in a string</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:33,480">actually got turned
into the number 4.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:36,860">And so the double
equal sign said,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:38,590">yes, these things
are exactly the same.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:41,330">But we didn't want that.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:42,510">Sometimes you might,
but not this time.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:44,980">So why should it matter
to us that the number 4</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:48,040">is different from the string 4?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:49,790">Well, up to now, in the
JavaScript Road Trip courses,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:53,260">we have always known that
the two values that we'd</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:55,990">be comparing would be
exactly the same type.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:01:58,950">That was to sort
of keep it simple</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:00,550">for you to understand
as we moved along.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:02,780">But as you grow in your skills
as a JavaScript programmer,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:05,570">you're going to
want to make sure</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:06,990">that the types that you get,
whether from files or from user</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:10,660">entry, match what
you're seeking.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:13,340">And so we need a different
way to compare types,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:16,680">as well as the values
contained within those types.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:19,950">Enter the triple
equals operator.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:22,240">The triple equals
operator does not</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:23,890">ignore the type of
the value in the way</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:26,650">that the double equals operator
will ignore the type for us.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:30,160">So therefore, we get sort
of a truer interpretation</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:33,330">of the equality here.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:35,110">And JavaScript
experts will often</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:36,930">prefer the triple
equals operator</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:39,490">over the double equals
operator for this reason.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:42,470">Here, you can see, when we use
a triple equals on x.value Of()</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:45,460">and y.value Of(), we get a false.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:50,470">value Of can be used on all
native JavaScript data types.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:54,730">So here, if we established a
variable called a and assigned</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:02:57,530">to it an array that contained
3, and then "blind",</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:00,630">and then "mice", and
we called a.value Of(),</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:04,210">we would just get
the array back.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:05,790">It's almost like
logging out the array.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:08,790">Same thing with
the number object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:11,350">You can see the
number constructor</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:12,880">being called on 6, over there.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:14,480">And if we logged out the value
of b, we would just get 6 back.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:19,930">Now, you might look at all
of these responses and think,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:22,650">they're just giving me
what the variable contains,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:25,060">so why wouldn't I
just use the variable?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:28,240">It's true, these
particular responses</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:30,050">are not very interesting.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:31,552">What's interesting,
though, is when</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:33,010">you redefine the value of
method for a classes prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:38,040">Let's take a look.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:43,320">What happens when we
call value Of on an object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:47,110">that we make, ourselves?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:49,190">Here, I've declared
a tornado variable.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:51,270">And I have assigned it
a function expression.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:53,850">Guess what?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:54,930">Constructors can be
function expressions, too.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:57,792">I'm going to pass in
a category - meaning</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:03:59,500">the severity of the
tornado - as well</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:02,000">as the affected
areas - that's going</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:03,500">to be an array of cities -
and then the maximum wind</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:06,900">gusts - that's going to be
how high the winds travel,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:09,570">in this tornado.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:10,970">Next, I'll need an array
of the affected areas.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:14,310">We'll call that cities.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:15,590">And inside that array,
there will be other arrays.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:19,430">In those sub-arrays,
in the first index</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:21,670">will be the city, and
in the second index will</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:23,890">be the population of
that city, for use later.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:26,940">Now, to create a
new tornado object,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:30,340">we'll establish a
twister variable</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:32,290">and pass in F5 - very strong.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:35,350">The city's array, as well
as 220 miles per hour winds.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:40,220">If we were to call
value Of on our new tornado</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:43,080">object, twister, we would get
a return of a tornado object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:48,460">with a list of all of its
properties and their values.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:52,140">But look at the
location property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:54,430">It says, Array[3].</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:55,860">That just tells me I've got an
array with three entries in it.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:04:59,030">It doesn't even
tell me that inside</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:00,640">that array is another array.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:02,470">So I don't even know
what's going on there.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:04,380">In other words, the
value Of is trying</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:06,180">to give me as much information
as it knows about this object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:10,260">But we have to be responsible
for making that value Of</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:13,570">method better.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:15,240">How can we do that?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:16,330">By overriding a
prototype's property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:19,869">Let's check it out.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:23,780">So why might we override
prototyping properties?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:26,860">Well, there are many
situations, as you might expect,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:30,170">that require special
functionality that's</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:32,760">different from the
first available property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:35,660">with that name inside
the prototype chain.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:39,330">But we want to caution you
to think of safety first,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:42,850">in this case, for overriding
because you want to make sure</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:45,720">that you don't
override a property -</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:47,460">let's say, in the object
prototype level - that</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:50,710">will affect all
objects everywhere -</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:53,290">shoes, tornadoes, boxes, books.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:56,660">We don't want that, necessarily,
for what we're about to do.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:05:59,160">We just want to override the
value Of method for tornadoes.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:03,960">So we're going to do that
inside of the tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:07,740">Let's take a look.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:09,280">So therefore, to get a
more informative result</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:12,360">for the value Of
method on tornadoes,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:14,900">we just want to modify
the tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:18,610">So what would be a
good redefinition</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:21,010">of the value Of
property for tornadoes?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:24,080">How about we make
it the sum of all</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:26,760">of the potential people
that are affected</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:29,000">by this particular tornado?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:31,000">Let's try that.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:32,470">Now, to make sure we only do
this in the tornado prototype,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:35,750">we're going to call
tornado.prototype.value Of,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:38,700">which creates a new property
inside the tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:43,120">Next, we'll assign
a function to it.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:44,630">And inside that, we'll
create a sum variable</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:48,290">that starts at zero.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:50,019">And then we'll have
a loop that loops</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:51,560">over every array inside
the cities array.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:56,360">Each time we get to a
new cell in the array,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:06:58,880">we'll add the
population of people</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:00,590">associated with that
city to our sum.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:03,300">And at the very end of
our value Of function,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:05,690">we will return the
sum of those people.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:12,620">So now, if we call
twister.value Of(),</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:15,170">we no longer get that big,
long list of properties</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:17,580">in the tornado object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:18,620">Instead, we get
641,647 people, which</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:23,370">is the sum of all of
the affected people</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:25,810">inside of our affected cities.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:27,950">Take note that the
value Of is found, now,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:30,930">in the tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:32,660">And that comes before
the object prototype</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:36,070">in the prototype chain.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:37,400">So therefore, the
value Of method that's</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:39,580">still in the object prototype
never gets even looked at.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:43,592">What's cool about this
kind of overriding</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:45,300">is that our value
will even update</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:47,100">as the cities array is updated.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:49,710">Say the tornado spreads its
damage to another location</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:53,100">and we need to add a city to it.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:54,860">Let's try that.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:56,220">If we tried to push a new
city into the cities array,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:07:59,280">with a new population of
130,045, what happens now,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:03,890">when we call twister.value Of()?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:05,930">We get 771,692.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:09,380">Why is that?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:10,150">That's because since the
cities array was passed</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:13,020">in by reference, we'll
always get an updated</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:16,480">value for that sum every
time value Of is called.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:19,240">How cool.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:23,030">Moving right along to another
useful prototype property,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:26,560">this one's called to String.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:28,800">Now, the default responses to
the objects to String method</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:33,450">are often very
uninteresting, especially</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:35,700">on the JavaScript native types.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:37,940">But overriding it can be cool.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:40,470">Let's take a look at what
the to String method does.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:43,669">Over here, we've got our
original x and y variables</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:46,020">with the same values.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:47,370">And as you might expect,
calling to String on x just</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:50,240">turns the 4 into the string 4.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:53,290">Calling to String on y doesn't
have much impact, just returns</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:56,780">the exact same string.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:08:59,490">Looking at the array, a call
to the to String on array</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:03,280">will just stringify
and concatenate</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:05,830">all of the contents, but
separating each entry</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:08,470">by a comma, without
any white space.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:10,890">So overriding to String
on the array prototype</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:14,210">is usually pretty desirable for
whatever you're trying to do.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:21,050">Additionally, the
to String method</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:22,560">can come in handy on a function.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:24,560">If we established a
new function here,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:26,860">and assigned it to
variable, double,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:28,550">and then called
double.to String(),</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:30,710">you can see that the entire
function is logged out</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:32,980">as a string, which can be
very useful if you ever need</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:36,010">to concatenate an entire
function as a string into some</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:39,930">formatted printout.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:44,070">Now, let's go ahead and
override our to String method</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:46,530">inside of our tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:48,450">We want to do something
cool with our to String</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:51,120">method in a tornado.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:52,594">So let's bring back in our
tornado constructor, as well as</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:55,010">our cities and our
new twister object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:09:58,020">And down here, we're going
to override the to String</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:00,830">method inside the
tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:03,430">You can then see here that
we assigned it a function</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:05,980">inside of which we'll
start a list variable that</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:09,310">is an empty string.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:10,570">What this is going
to do is hold a list</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:12,430">of the affected
areas in the cities.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:15,820">Then we'll loop over all of the
arrays inside the cities array.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:21,410">Inside of our loop,
if we haven't yet</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:23,800">reached the last
city, then we just</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:26,040">want to add the name of the
city and a comma to our list.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:29,220">But if we did reach the
very last city in our array,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:33,070">we want to use the
Oxford comma style,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:34,820">and have some good grammar,
and put and, the last city.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:39,020">Notice here that the
cities are contained</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:41,120">in the zero index
of each sub-array.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:45,140">Once the loop closes, we'll
know that our list variable</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:47,950">is complete, meaning
all of the cities</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:50,340">have been concatenated
correctly into one variable.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:53,840">Then we will return this
rather large string,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:56,220">here, that says, "This tornado
has been classified as an,"</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:10:59,880">and then we'll put the category
in for this particular tornado.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:02,970">"With wind gusts up to," and
we'll put the wind gusts</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:06,092">in for this tornado.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:08,569">New sentence.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:09,110">"Affected areas are,"
and notice now,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:11,540">we concatenate the
list variable in.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:13,840">That will put all of
our cities in one spot.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:17,950">"Potentially affecting
a population of,"</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:20,600">and now, this is
cool - we actually</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:22,380">are calling our overridden
value Of method on this.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:27,500">So we will get the population
placed right there.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:30,689">Let's check it out.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:35,250">If we call
twister.to String() now,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:38,210">we get a very cool
representation of all</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:40,350">of the data that's in our
twister tornado object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:43,940">It says, this tornado has
been classified as an F5,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:47,060">with the wind gusts up
to 220 miles per hour.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:50,210">Affected areas are Kansas City,
Topeka, Lenexa, and Olethe,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:11:56,010">potentially affecting a
population of 771,692.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:02,200">Cool, huh?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:04,562">Next up, we're
going to try to find</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:06,020">an object's constructor
and its prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:09,050">And there are some inherited
properties from the object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:11,480">prototype that
provide ways for us</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:13,920">to locate those nearest
prototype ancestors.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:17,580">Let's check that out.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:19,120">If we call
twister.constructor here,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:21,330">we get the entire constructor
function back, as a result.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:26,720">Now, next, if we call
the .prototype property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:31,080">of the constructor function, we
will get the prototype object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:36,330">associated with
that constructor.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:39,080">Pretty cool.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:40,110">So there, we can see both the
constructor function, as well</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:43,480">as the prototype object that
has our overridden value Of</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:48,130">and to String methods.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:50,500">Something useful
to remember here</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:52,340">is that if a prototype object
is defined for a class,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:55,770">meaning the class
uses inheritance</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:12:57,400">in some way, that
prototype will always</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:00,750">be a property of the
class's constructor.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:04,010">And the constructor is just
another function object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:06,220">of the properties.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:09,610">Another way to access just
the prototype would be</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:12,040">twister.__proto__.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:16,200">Kind of weird, but it will give
you back the exact prototype</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:22,030">object used for twister.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:27,525">Now that you know how
to access the prototype</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:29,400">and the constructor,
let's take a look</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:30,983">at the has Own Property method
in the object prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:35,610">This method will
help you identify</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:37,430">the location of properties
where they are stored.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:41,930">Searching the prototype chains
for potential overridden</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:45,540">properties is
something we do a lot.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:47,960">And it becomes very
easy with this function.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:50,530">What if we wanted to find the
owner of a particular property?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:55,082">Well, we can build a
function to do that.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:56,790">Let's check it out.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:13:59,140">So what if we wanted to be able
to find a specific property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:03,340">within an object's
prototype chain?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:05,380">Hm.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:06,290">We wanted to find which location
held a specific property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:11,090">Well, we can add that one
to the object.prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:14,310">That way, every
object, everywhere,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:16,330">will be able to
find any property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:18,000">that we want to look for.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:19,770">So here you can see we're doing
object.prototype.find Owner Of Property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:25,010">And then we assign
it a function.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:27,640">The function takes in, as
a parameter, the property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:29,950">name that we're looking for.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:31,940">The first thing we'll do is
establish a variable called</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:34,780">current Object which will be
the object within which we're</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:38,920">looking for the
property, currently.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:41,410">And at first, we
will assign that</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:43,080">to this, which means
the calling object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:45,780">We want to start at
the calling object,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:47,930">to see if the property is there.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:50,540">Next, we'll hook ourselves
up with a while loop that</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:53,010">will keep searching
the prototype chain</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:14:55,250">until we've tried to go beyond
the object prototype which</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:00,420">has no prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:02,750">So if we tried to access
the prototype of the object</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:06,200">prototype, we would get no
because object prototype is</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:09,510">the highest prototype
that you can go.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:12,320">Then we'll set up a
conditional in which</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:14,000">we check whether the current
object, has Own Property,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:18,750">the property name that
we're looking for.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:20,610">And if it does, we'll
return that current object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:23,040">Why?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:24,250">Because if the current
object has the property name</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:28,010">that we're looking
for, that means</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:30,070">it is the closest object,
in hierarchy, to the calling</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:34,260">object, which means
that's where it gets</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:37,530">the method, or the
property, from.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:41,470">Otherwise, if the currently
examined object does not</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:44,400">contain the property
that we're looking for,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:47,100">then we need to proceed
up the prototype chain</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:50,100">to find that property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:51,800">Hm.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:52,300">How do we do that?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:53,100">Well, we say that the
current object should now</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:56,370">be whatever the
previously looked</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:15:58,500">at object's prototype was.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:01,080">That helps us move up
the prototype chain.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:03,910">Then, at the end,
if the loop exits,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:06,490">we know we tried to get past the
object prototype and hit null.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:11,100">What does that mean?</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:12,190">That means we never
found the property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:14,330">in any of the prototypes
throughout the chain.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:17,080">So we should go ahead and let
ourselves know that and say,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:19,860">no property found.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:22,780">So now, if we call the
find Owner Of Property on twister,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:26,570">with the parameter
value Of, meaning</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:28,810">we're looking for
the value Of property,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:31,540">well, twister looks inside
itself, as an object,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:33,630">and doesn't see
value Of, so it goes up</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:36,390">to the tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:37,660">And there it is, the
value Of function.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:41,300">So our
find Owner Of Property method</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:45,030">returns the entire
tornado prototype to us</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:48,970">as the location of
the value Of property.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:54,460">Now, if we call our function
on the go To Oz property, hm.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:16:58,930">Well, we'll first check
the twister object.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:01,190">Nothing there.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:02,570">And then we'll head up
to the tornado prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:05,104">Nothing there, either.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:06,020">Uh oh.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:07,460">So now we'll trudge up
to the object prototype.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:10,490">Still nothing.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:12,400">Finally, we'll try to get
past the object prototype,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:15,190">but that prototype is null.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:17,550">Womp, womp.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:18,720">But actually, that's cool
because our while loop will</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:21,420">exit, and we'll get
no property found.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:25,030">So we see that trying to
find the go To Oz property</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:28,710">shows us that none
actually exists</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:30,730">for this particular tornado,
which, I have to say,</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:34,380">kind of sucks.</span>
      <span class="mouseover" title="00:17:38,760">And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is the end of a level five,</span>
